**Unpacking List Problem**


​
numbers = input("Enter numbers: ")              #used function int
yourcode = list(map(int, numbers.split()))      #declaring yourcode as int and it split the integers
​
first = yourcode [0]                            #used a slicing method to separate the inputted numbers
middle = yourcode[1: -1]
last = yourcode[-1]
​
#Output of the program 
print("First:" , first)
print("Second: ", middle)
print("Last: ", last)
